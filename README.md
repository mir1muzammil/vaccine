import the sql file in a database named "vaccination_db"

Admin Panel Email: admin@example.com
Admin Panel Password: admin123

(can create new login credentials by inserting new ones in the admin and hospital table in sql)

Hospital Panel Email: hospital@gmail.com
Hospital Panel Password: 12345

for parent just register and login

It will work with any folder inside xampp/htdocs but for assurance create a folder named "eproject" then inside it import the git and rename the folder name from "vaccine" to "vaccination-management"
other than that the website should work flawlessly
